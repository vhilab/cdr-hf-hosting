<h1>Idea Generation Scenario</h1>

You are a co-founder in an early stage start-up in the Bay Area. Your founding team came up
with a product concept that would revolutionize how college students travel from their
dorms to their classesâ€¦ an electric skateboard! However early user tests did were not
promising. Some users commented on the preference for the aesthetics of a traditional
longboard, others were skeptical of controlling electric skateboards.

Your team took this user feedback to heart and decided that you needed to break away from
comparison with skateboard. You have decided to pivot and generate a new product
concept, one that will define its own category of personal urban transportation.

You are now at a brainstorming meeting to generate new ideas on what this personal urban
transportation solution could be for the next generation of college youth. Spend the next 10
min in a rapid brainstorm of concepts that will revolutionize personal urban transport!
