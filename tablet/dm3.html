<div class="content">
<p> You are part of a design team working for a major design consultancy in the US. You have been
approached by a major non-profit working in Nigeria in the field of healthcare. The non-profit
has asked you to tackle the challenge of childcare of pre-mature babies. More than 20% of all
babies born pre-mature are not able to survive for more than a few days. The non-profit has
identified the low availability of incubators as a key factor. They have asked your team to
consider redesigning how incubators are designed or serviced. </p>

<p> Your team visited Nigeria and did user research. You have discovered that there are multiple
focus areas that you could target. You could target urban slums and redesign low-cost
incubators for government hospitals in major metropolitan areas like Lagos or Abuja. Or you
could target the far-flung rural areas and address the issues of pre-mature babies born at
home. Make a decision, which area your team should choose to focus on. You have 15 min. </p>

<p>Facts:
	<ol>
		<li>A well-known doctor in a prestigious hospital in Lagos is keen on you testing your
		solution at his hospital. </li>
		<li>The liaison from your client organization who has support on-ground is excited by your
		urban area findings. </li>
		<li>The health minister from the Nigerian government you met talked highly of providing
		affordable medical solutions to villages.</li>
		<li>The cost of developing a rural solution to be greater for your project because of added
		travel and low availability of communication technology.</li>
	</ol>
	Questions:
	<ol>
		<li>What ethical principles are you considering when making your decision?</li>
		<li>Is any decision more suited for your design process?</li>
	</ol>
