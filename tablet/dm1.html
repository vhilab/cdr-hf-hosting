<h1>Decision-Making Team</h1>

<p> You are part of a design team working for a major design consultancy in the US. You have been
approached by a major non-profit working in Nigeria in the field of healthcare. The non-profit
has asked you to tackle the challenge of childcare of pre-mature babies. More than 20% of all
babies born pre-mature are not able to survive for more than a few days. The non-profit has
identified the low availability of incubators as a key factor. They have asked your team to
consider redesigning how incubators are designed or serviced. </p>

<p> Your team visited Nigeria and did user research. You have discovered that there are multiple
focus areas that you could target. You could target urban slums and redesign low-cost
incubators for government hospitals in major metropolitan areas like Lagos or Abuja. Or you
could target the far-flung rural areas and address the issues of pre-mature babies born at
home. Make a decision, which area your team should choose to focus on. You have 15 min. </p>

<p>Facts:
	<ol>
		<li> 70% of pre-mature babies are born in rural areas. </li>
		<li> You have just 3 months to design and test a solution. Urban area solution could be more
	logistically feasible than a rural area solution. </li>
		<li> You met Lola, a young woman living in the rural eastern part of Nigeria and she told you
	a moving story of losing her first daughter because she was born pre-mature and
	medical help was not available. </li>
	</ol>
	Questions:
	<ol>
		<li> Which area are you personally motivated to address? </li>
		<li> Which focus area solution will be within the scope of the client organizationâ€™s capacity? </li>
		<li> What defines a successful completion of the project for us? </li>
	</ol>
