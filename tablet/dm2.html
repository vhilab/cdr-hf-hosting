<div class="content">
<p> You are part of a design team working for a major design consultancy in the US. You have been
approached by a major non-profit working in Nigeria in the field of healthcare. The non-profit
has asked you to tackle the challenge of childcare of pre-mature babies. More than 20% of all
babies born pre-mature are not able to survive for more than a few days. The non-profit has
identified the low availability of incubators as a key factor. They have asked your team to
consider redesigning how incubators are designed or serviced. </p>

<p> Your team visited Nigeria and did user research. You have discovered that there are multiple
focus areas that you could target. You could target urban slums and redesign low-cost
incubators for government hospitals in major metropolitan areas like Lagos or Abuja. Or you
could target the far-flung rural areas and address the issues of pre-mature babies born at
home. Make a decision, which area your team should choose to focus on. You have 15 min. </p>

<p>Facts:
	<ol>
		<li>You visited hospitals in Nigerian cities that had 
		broken incubators that no one knew how to fix.</li>
		<li>You met mid-wives in your rural journey that told you heart-breaking 
		tales of the difficulties they face with pre-mature birth.</li>
		<li>The CEO of your non-profit client is excited by your rural area findings.</li>
	</ol>
	Questions:
	<ol>
		<li>What is the difference in needs between rural area and urban area?</li>
		<li>What focus area is in the best interest of your client?</li>
	</ol>
