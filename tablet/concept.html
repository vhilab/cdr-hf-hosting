<div class="content">
    <p>You are a co-founder in an early stage start-up in the Bay Area. Your founding team came up
	with a product concept that would revolutionize how college students travel from their
	dorms to their classesâ€¦ an electric skateboard! However early user tests did were not
	promising. Some users commented on the preference for the aesthetics of a traditional
	longboard, others were skeptical of controlling electric skateboards.</p>

	<p>Your team took this user feedback to heart and decided that you needed to break away from
	comparison with skateboard. You have decided to pivot and generate a new product
	concept, one that will define its own category of personal urban transportation.</p>

	<p>You are now at a brainstorming meeting to generate new ideas on what this personal urban
	transportation solution could be for the next generation of college youth. Spend the next 10
	min in a rapid brainstorm of concepts that will revolutionize personal urban transport!</p>
